This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook containing 
results
from the social network data from CLC Project 5.

##  Background

We start by describing the origial dataset. Load the needed data:

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "/Volumes/caas/CADRE CLC Data Project5/Clean Data/AK-SU-NETWORKS-ROUT")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())

library(haven)
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

# Set working directory ---------------------------
#setwd("/Volumes/caas/CADRE CLC Data Project5/Clean Data/AK-SU-NETWORKS-ROUT")

# Load complete (individual+network) data ---------------------------
load(file="/Volumes/caas/CADRE CLC Data Project5/Clean Data/AK-SU-NETWORKS-ROUT/eda.RData") 
```

We know that the `dt` dataset contains the sample of `r paste("n =", nrow(dt))` 
used for the original paper (Monnig 2021, JMIR). Of these `r nrow(dt)`, we 
focused our analysis on the participants who consented
to providing social network data.  

```{r}
dim(dt)
sns_consenting_dt <- dt %>% 
  filter(FUSNCONSENT == 7)
dim(sns_consenting_dt)

table(dt$FUSNCONSENT, exclude = NULL)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
vars <- colnames(sns_consenting_dt)
sns_vars <- which(substr(vars, 6, 7) == "SN")
length(sns_vars)
head(colnames(sns_consenting_dt[sns_vars]))
```

We thus filterered out the survey participants who did not consent to 
participate with an affirmative response to the statement:
"Yes, I agree that I have read this document, that I am 18 years of age or older, 
and I would like to participate in this study.'' We have a dataset of
`r nrow(sns_consenting_dt)` participants, reporting on a number of 
attributes of their network members, structured in `r length(sns_vars)` columns, 
with names such as `r vars[sns_vars[1]]`, `r vars[sns_vars[2]]`, ...,
`r vars[sns_vars[length(sns_vars)]]`.

## Network Descriptives

How many friends are reported on?

We look at the reported ages of the network members, and count any non-missing 
ages as friends we have reports on. 

```{r}
age_net_dt <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(#comp_code_Text_Set,
                FUA4_SN2,
                FUA5_SN2,
                FUA6_SN2,
                FUA7_SN2,
                FUA8_SN2
  )
round(apply(age_net_dt, 2, function (x) summary(x)), 2)
apply(age_net_dt, 2, function (x) which(is.na(x)))
```
Since there are no missing age reports, we have 
`r nrow(age_net_dt)*ncol(age_net_dt)` social network members on whom data have 
been collected.


There seem to be some reports on minors (age < 18 years). We will count how many and remove them
from the analysis:

```{r}
dim(age_net_dt)
minors_reported <- apply(age_net_dt, 2, function (x) which(x < 18))
minors_reported
unlist(minors_reported) 
```
Thus there are `r length(unlist(minors_reported))` minors in the dataset who 
will need to be removed. But, to remove them from the dataset, we will
first have to convert the wide dataset to long.  

We first extract the social network columns of interest:

```{r}

head(colnames(sns_consenting_dt))

sns_dt_only <- (sns_consenting_dt[,sns_vars])
sns_dt_only$MTURK1 <- sns_consenting_dt$MTURK1 #MTURK ID
sns_dt_only$comp_code_Text_Set <-sns_consenting_dt$comp_code_Text_Set #STUDYID

dim(sns_dt_only)

sns_dt_only <- as.data.table(sns_dt_only)
class(sns_dt_only)
```

Extract the network data columns that are necessary, and combine them into
a long-wide format: 
 - Each network member ID is presented top to bottom (i.e., long) for each study participant
 - The attributes of each person are added to each network member from left to right (i.e., wide) 


```{r}
colnames(sns_consenting_dt)
dim(sns_consenting_dt)


extr_cols <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(starts_with("FUA4_"))
colnames(extr_cols)

colnames_net_dt <- lapply(colnames(extr_cols), function(x) substr(x, 6, nchar(x)))

net_A4 <- sns_consenting_dt %>% select(starts_with("FUA4_"))
dim(net_A4)
colnames(net_A4) <- colnames_net_dt

net_A5 <- sns_consenting_dt %>% select(starts_with("FUA5_"))
dim(net_A5)
colnames(net_A5) <- colnames_net_dt

net_A6 <- sns_consenting_dt %>% select(starts_with("FUA5_"))
dim(net_A6)
colnames(net_A6) <- colnames_net_dt

net_A7 <- sns_consenting_dt %>% select(starts_with("FUA5_"))
dim(net_A7)
colnames(net_A7) <- colnames_net_dt

net_A8 <- sns_consenting_dt %>% select(starts_with("FUA5_"))
dim(net_A8)
colnames(net_A8) <- colnames_net_dt

sns_dt_long_wide <- rbind(net_A4, net_A5, net_A6, net_A7, net_A8)
dim(sns_dt_long_wide)
colnames(sns_dt_long_wide)


sns_dt_long_wide$MTURKID <- sns_consenting_dt$MTURK1
sns_dt_long_wide$comp_code_Text_Set <- sns_consenting_dt$comp_code_Text_Set

dim(sns_dt_long_wide)
colnames(sns_dt_long_wide)
```

Now delete the rows containing minor age network members:

```{r}
minor_age_rows <- which(sns_dt_long_wide$SN2 < 18)
length(minor_age_rows)

sns_dt_long_wide_no_minors <-
  sns_dt_long_wide %>%
  filter(SN2 >= 18)

dim(sns_dt_long_wide)
dim(sns_dt_long_wide_no_minors)
```



##  Network Analysis

### Sample Substance Use Variable of Interest

For example, the variables "FUAX_SN20"report 
cigarette smoking in the network, tabulated as follows:
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
cig_net_dt <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(#comp_code_Text_Set,
                FUA4_SN20,
                FUA5_SN20,
                FUA6_SN20,
                FUA7_SN20,
                FUA8_SN20
  )

```

```{r}
(apply(cig_net_dt, 2, function (x) table(x, exclude = NULL)))
```


The variables `r colnames(cig_net_dt)[[1]]` through `r colnames(cig_net_dt)[[5]]` 
report smoking in the 5 reported  network members, 
where 1 represents "yes", and 2 represents "no". 
Restricting ourselves to the confirmed yes and no reports, the proportion of
smoking persons in the social network of our MTurk sample is:  

```{r}
round(apply(cig_net_dt, 2, function (x) length(which(x==1))/sum(table(x))), 3)
```

### Analysis of Full Network Dataset

Other reported characteristics of the social network members include: 
age (SN2), 

```{r}
age_net_dt <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(#comp_code_Text_Set,
                FUA4_SN2,
                FUA5_SN2,
                FUA6_SN2,
                FUA7_SN2,
                FUA8_SN2
  )
round(apply(age_net_dt, 2, function (x) summary(x)), 2)
```
(Looks like we have reports on some children; these might have to be deleted
since the survey was meant to interview adults?)

race (SN3),

```{r}
race_net_dt_white <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(#comp_code_Text_Set,
                FUA4_SN3_1,
                FUA5_SN3_1,
                FUA6_SN3_1,
                FUA7_SN3_1,
                FUA8_SN3_1
  )

race_net_dt_black <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(#comp_code_Text_Set,
                FUA4_SN3_2,
                FUA5_SN3_2,
                FUA6_SN3_2,
                FUA7_SN3_2,
                FUA8_SN3_2
  )

apply(race_net_dt_white, 2, function (x) table(x))
apply(race_net_dt_black, 2, function (x) table(x))

(I will need to recode the other race categories since each is reported in a 
separated column);
