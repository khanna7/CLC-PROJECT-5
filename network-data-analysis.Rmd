This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook containing 
results
from the social network data from CLC Project 5.

##  Background

We start by describing the origial dataset. Load the needed data:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(haven)
library(dplyr)

# Set working directory ---------------------------
setwd("/Volumes/caas/CADRE CLC Data Project5/Clean Data/AK-SU-NETWORKS-ROUT")

# Load complete (individual+network) data ---------------------------
load(file="eda.RData") #from "../Coronavirus Pandemic_Merge_AllData.SAV") 

```

We know that the `dt` dataset contains the sample of `r paste("n =", nrow(dt))` 
used for the original paper (Monnig 2021, JMIR). Of these `r nrow(dt)`, we 
focused our analysis on the participants who consented
to providing social network data.  

```{r}
dim(dt)
sns_consenting_dt <- dt %>% 
  filter(FUSNCONSENT == 7)
dim(sns_consenting_dt)

table(dt$FUSNCONSENT, exclude = NULL)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
vars <- colnames(sns_consenting_dt)
sns_vars <- which(substr(vars, 6, 7) == "SN")
```

We thus filterered out the survey participants who did not consent to 
participate with an affirmative response to the statement:
"Yes, I agree that I have read this document, that I am 18 years of age or older, 
and I would like to participate in this study.'' We have a dataset of
`r nrow(sns_consenting_dt)` participants, reporting on a number of 
attributes of their network members, structured in `r length(sns_vars)` columns, 
with names such as `r vars[sns_vars[1]]`, `r vars[sns_vars[2]]`, ...,
`r vars[sns_vars[length(sns_vars)]]`.

For example, the variables "FUAX_SN20"report 
cigarette smoking in the network, tabulated as follows:
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
cig_net_dt <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(#comp_code_Text_Set,
                FUA4_SN20,
                FUA5_SN20,
                FUA6_SN20,
                FUA7_SN20,
                FUA8_SN20
  )

```

```{r}
(apply(cig_net_dt, 2, function (x) table(x, exclude = NULL)))
```


The variables `r colnames(cig_net_dt)[[1]]` through `r colnames(cig_net_dt)[[5]]` 
report smoking in the 5 reported  network members, 
where 1 represents "yes", and 2 represents "no". 
Restricting ourselves to the confirmed yes and no reports, the proportion of
smoking persons in the social network of our MTurk sample is:  

```{r}
round(apply(cig_net_dt, 2, function (x) length(which(x==1))/sum(table(x))), 3)
```

Other reported characteristics of the social network members include: 
age (SN2), 

```{r}
age_net_dt <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(#comp_code_Text_Set,
                FUA4_SN2,
                FUA5_SN2,
                FUA6_SN2,
                FUA7_SN2,
                FUA8_SN2
  )
round(apply(age_net_dt, 2, function (x) summary(x)), 2)
```
(Looks like we have reports on some children; these might have to be deleted
since the survey was meant to interview adults?)

race (SN3),

```{r}
race_net_dt_white <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(#comp_code_Text_Set,
                FUA4_SN3_1,
                FUA5_SN3_1,
                FUA6_SN3_1,
                FUA7_SN3_1,
                FUA8_SN3_1
  )

race_net_dt_black <- 
  sns_consenting_dt %>% select(#comp_code_Text_Set,
                FUA4_SN3_2,
                FUA5_SN3_2,

  )

apply(race_net_dt_white, 2, function (x) table(x))
apply(race_net_dt_black, 2, function (x) table(x))

(I will need to recode the other race categories since each is reported in a 
separated column);
